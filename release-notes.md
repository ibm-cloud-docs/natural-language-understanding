# Release notes for {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}}
{: #release-notes}

The following new features and changes to the service are available.
{: shortdesc}

## Service API versioning
{: #service-api-versioning}
{: release-note}

**Current API version**: 2022-08-10

API requests require a version parameter that takes the date in the format `version=YYYY-MM-DD`. Send the version parameter with every API request.

When we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new minor version. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, change the value of the version parameter to the new date. If you're not ready to update to that version, don't change your version date.

### Active version dates
{: #active-version-dates}
{: release-note}

The following table shows the service behavior changes for each version date. Switching to a later version date will activate all changes introduced in earlier versions.

{: release-note}

Full support for IBM Cloud IAM
:   {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} now supports the full implementation of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). API keys for Watson services are no longer limited to a single service instance. You can create access policies and API keys that apply to more than one service, and you can grant access between services.

To support this change, the API service endpoints use a different domain and include the service instance ID. 

- The pattern is `api.{location}.{offering}.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}`.

- Example URL for an instance hosted in the Dallas location: `api.us-south.natural-language-understanding.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/6bbda3b3-d572-45e1-8c54-22d6ed9e52c2`

- The previous public endpoint domain was `watsonplatform.net`.

For more information about the URLs, see the [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/natural-language-understanding/natural-language-understanding#service-endpoint){: external}.

These URLs do not introduce a breaking change. The new URLs work both for your existing service instances and for new instances. The original URLs continue to work on your existing service instances for at least one year (until December 2020).

For more information about IAM, see [Authenticating to Watson services](/docs/watson?topic=watson-iam).

New network and data security features
:   Support for data encryption with customer-managed keys
Users of new premium and dedicated instances can integrate {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} with {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} to encrypt their data and manage encryption keys. For more information, see [Protecting sensitive information in your Watson service](/docs/watson?topic=watson-keyservice).

:   Support for private network endpoints
Users of Premium plans can create private network endpoints to connect to {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} over a private network. Connections to private network endpoints do not require public internet access. For more information, see [Public and private network endpoints](/docs/watson?topic=watson-public-private-endpoints).

Korean language support improved
:   [Korean language support](/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-language-support#korean) has expanded to include the following features:

- Entities
- Keywords
- Semantic Roles

## 30 July 2017
{: #natural-language-understanding-jul3017}
{: release-note}

Limit number of characters processed
:   You can control cost by using the optional `limit_text_characters` parameter to limit the number of characters that are processed. For example,

```bash
{
  "text": "The United States of America, commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west.",
  "features": {
    "entities": {}
  },
  "limit_text_characters": 50,
  "return_analyzed_text": true
}
```

- Each character counts as one character, regardless of whether the character is a single-byte character or a multibyte character.

- For metering, one {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} Item continues to be one feature (also known as an enrichment) per one text unit. One text unit is 10,000 characters or less.

- For detailed pricing information, see [{{site.data.keyword.nlushort}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/natural-language-understanding) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Catalog.

In addition to adding the `limit_text_characters` parameter, the following changes were made to text size limits and truncation:

- All text greater than 50,000 characters is truncated before processing. Previously, truncation was based on kilobytes, where one kilobyte equaled 1024 bytes.

- An informational message is returned in the response when text beyond 50,000 characters is truncated.

- Text limit size for custom models has increased from 10,000 characters to 50,000 characters.

- Usage information is added to the response for clarity around number of {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} Items used for each request. For example,

```bash
{
  "usage": {
    "text_units": 5,
    "text_characters": 41186,
    "features": 1
  },
  ...
}
```
