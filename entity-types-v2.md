# Entity types (Version 2)
{: #entity-types-version-2}

The following tables list the entity types and subtypes that are used in the _Version 2_ entity type system.
{: shortdesc}

The entity type system that {{site.data.keyword.nlushort}} uses differs based on which version date and which language you are using. For more details, see the [Entity types systems](/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-entity-type-systems) page.

## Entity subtypes
{: #subtypes-version-2}

Subtypes are determined by the disambiguated entity, not the entity type. There is no strict relationship between entity types and entity subtypes.
